Summary
This program will allow the user to enter a number for the adjacent side while the angle would be random,
this will display the hypotenuse.
Variables
* nearest_angle_degrees
* adjacent_side
* angle_radians
* hypotenuse_length
* math
* random
Functions
* calculate_hypotenuse(nearest_angle_degrees,adjacent_side)
* main()


Design Process
1. Using the import math and random will help with the math equation for this code.
2. Next, write a code where the angle and adjacent converts into hypotenuse.
3. After this, generate a random between 1 through 89.
4. Make it where the user can type in any number they want for the adjacent side.
5. Once you do that, this will display the result on how long the hypotenuse is.
