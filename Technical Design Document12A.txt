Design Process
1. Using the CVS file from week 7 to make this part.
2. Enter w to write the grades to CSV.
3. Once you finish with that your information would be save to the cvs file
5. To open it, type in "r" to display the results from the csv, it would also display as a group box:

with open('grades.csv', mode='r') as file:
        reader = csv.reader(file)
        headers = next(reader)
        
        print("{:<15} {:<15} {:<8} {:<8} {:<8}".format(*headers))
        print("="*54)
        
        for row in reader:
            print("{:<15} {:<15} {:<8} {:<8} {:<8}".format(*row))

if __name__ == "__main__":

6. You can also type "a" to display the mean and all that with 2 or more students.

6. At the end, it will display error if you choice the wrong choice. Make sure to enter 'w', 'r' or 'q'.
