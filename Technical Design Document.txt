Summary
A program that allows the user to determine on the whether it's either legit or a spam. The user will have unlimited attempts to see if it's 
not a spam or highly one.

Variables
* spam_words
* spam_score
* detected_keywords
* word
* count
* score
* total_spam_score
* message
* likelihood

Functions
* main()
* calculate_spam_score(message)
*determine_spam_likelihood(score)

Design Process
1. Create a list of 30 words that are commonly found in spam messages.
2. Initialize calculate_spam_score(message) that will be used to take email message as the input.
3. After, create a determine_spam_likelihood(score) that will be used to illustrate the chance of it being a spam.
4. Once the whole process at the top is done, the main() will be here to flow the overall program process,
then the total_spam_score will be here for the score count of spams and all.
5. Exit the while loop and print the results.
6. The main function at the end is here to help with the code.
