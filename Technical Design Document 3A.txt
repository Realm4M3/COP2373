Summary
A program will allowed the user to put in a list of their monthly expenses. It will also display their total, their highest, and their lowest expense.

Variables
* expenses
* expense_type
* amount
* total_expense
* highest_expense
* lowest_expense

Functions
* main()
* get_expenses()
* analyze_expenses(expenses)

Design Process
1. Create a loop that allows the user to either type in their expense or type in done
2. Type in the amount you want for your expenses
3. Display none at all, only if you add nothing
4. Once half the whole process at the top is done, the other part for the calculating will display
5. Once done with the loop type in done to see the results
6. The main function at the end is here to help with the code.
