* units
* name
* account_number
* amount

Functions
* __new__(cls, v, units='USD')
* __init__(self, v, units='USD')
* __add__(self, other)
* __sub__(self, other)
* __mul__(self, other)
* __str__(self)
* __init__(self, name, account_number, amount, deposit_interest_rate, withdraw_interest_rate, units='USD
* adjust_deposit_interest_rate(self, new_rate)
* adjust_withdraw_interest_rate(self, new_rate)

Design Process
1. The user will us the information in Programming Exercise 9A and rewrite it
2. Next, you will use the add and subtract methods from the Money class.
3. Keep the same test function from 9A.
4. Type in your information and all of that.
5. Once you put everything in it will display your result.
