Design Process
1. You will put in on how much students you want.
2. Creating a cvs file to store the information there when done.
3. Then, you will put in your first and last name in this code, as well as your 3 test score.
4. Once you finish with that your information would be save to the cvs file
5. To open it, type in "r" to display the results from the csv, it would also display as a group box:

with open('grades.csv', mode='r') as file:
        reader = csv.reader(file)
        headers = next(reader)
        
        print("{:<15} {:<15} {:<8} {:<8} {:<8}".format(*headers))
        print("="*54)
        
        for row in reader:
            print("{:<15} {:<15} {:<8} {:<8} {:<8}".format(*row))

if __name__ == "__main__":

6. At the end, it will display error if you choice the wrong choice. Make sure to enter 'w', 'r' or 'q'.
